Project Description / Outline:
We have analyzed historical trend of FIFA in this analysis. To be more specific, we have chosen booking , first goal , top scorer , regional and penalty kicks as main focuses of our analysis. The goal of our analysis is that to determine if there is a significant difference between winners and non-winners in terms of the above mentioned areas.
Research Questions & Analysis
Q1: Comparing winners' booking performances Vs non-winners booking performances
-Based on the box-plots, there is no outlier for booking with both yellow and red cards with our winners. On the other hand, there are outliers for our non winners. Also, non-winners data is more spread out especially on the last quartile (75% -100%).
-We can see that there is not a strong correlation between receiving more bookings and winning FIFA.
-Over the years , average yellow card per game has been increased for both winners and non winners, but non- winners had higher increase than winners. P value is 0.03
-In terms of red cards, winners and non-winners have identical trends and very stagnant over the years.
Q2: How many times did the winning team score first in games vs non-winning teams?
-We can see that not only the gap between the 2 has increased over the years, winners have an increasing tendency and non winners have decreasing tendency. It shows that scoring first goal is a strong factor to become winner probably due to psychological effect.
#Q3: Did a single player score most of the winning team’s goals throughout the tournament Vs non-wining team?
-Winning teams have a tendency to have more diverse (multiple high scoring players) , versus non winning teams have a tendency to have fewer high scoring players. Looking at the bar charts, the winning team’s best player scored 5 goals (more or less), the winning team’s best player scored 10 goals (more or less). Not only that, for the winning teams ,the average percentage scored by single player is 35%, versus for non winning team, the average percentage scored by single player is 50%.
#Q4:how often the host country was the winning country as well as determining the trend in consecutive winners.
57% of the winners are from Europe , and the rest (43%) is from South America. All the winners came from only 2 regions in the history of FIFA. It is obvious that the region is the strong factor to become a winner.
#Q5:To determine the range of penalty kicked, awarded and converted (scored) of the winners Vs non-winner
Looking at the scatter plots, the winning teams tend to have less number of penalty kicks received than non winning teams, but their conversion rate is higher than non winning teams. To be exact, the winning team had 4 penalty kicks in total , 2 out of 4 , the conversion rate is 100% and 2 out of 4 , the conversion rate is 80% (missed only one penalty goal). If you miss more than 1 penalty kick, the chances of becoming a FIFA winner is gonna be slim.
Conclusion
The below is the summary of our main findings from the analysis. -Winners have a tendency to receive less yellow cards per game on average than non-winners. In terms of red cards, there is no relevance. -Winners have been scoring the first goals at much higher percentage than non winners. The gap has been increasing over time. -Winners have more diverse scoring squad than non winners. -All the winners came from only 2 regions in the history of FIFA. ( Europe -57% , South America-43%) -Winners tend to have less number of penalty kicks received than non winning teams, but their conversion rate is higher than non winning teams .
