### Project Description / Outline:
A person goes through a range of emotions while watching their country play the soccer game on the field. Failure, success, last minute winners, etc, are part of this beautiful game and a reason why this is the most watched spectacle. This game is about fine margins. Aside from emotions, there are several factors which distinguish a world cup winner from the rest. We as a data analytics team, have researched few factors and we will be presenting following analysis to our audience; 

### Research Questions & Analysis

Q1: Comparing winners' booking performances Vs non-winners booking performances

-Based on the box-plots, there is no outlier for booking with both yellow and red cards with our winners. On the other hand, there are outliers for our non winners. Also, non-winners data is more spread out especially on the last quartile (75% -100%).

-We can see that there is not a strong correlation between receiving more bookings and winning FIFA.

-For yellow cards: 7 out of 13 , winner received more yellow cards, 6 out of 13 - non winner received more yellow cards.

-For red cards: 5 out of 13 , winner received more red cards, 6 out of 13 - non winner received more red. cards. 2 out of 13, both received the same number of red cards.

-However, We can see that bookings have increased over the years for yellow cards but not for red in both winners and non-winners. 


Q2: How many times did the winning team score first in games vs non-winning teams?

-Looking at the bar chart, you can see that prior to 1980 there was a smaller discrepancy between winners and non winners scoring the first goal, however in recent years, winners have been scoring the first goal more frequently.

-Looking at the scatter plot, there is a strong tendency for the winners to have more games where they scored the first goal , compared to the non winning teams. 

#Q3: Did a single player score most of the winning team’s goals throughout the tournament Vs non-wining team?

-Winning teams have a tendency to have more diverse (multiple high scoring players) , versus non winning teams have a tendency to have fewer high scoring players. Looking at the bar charts, the winning team’s best player scored 5 goals (more or less), the winning team’s best player scored 10 goals (more or less). Not only that, for the winning teams ,the average percentage scored by single player is 35%, versus for non winning team, the average percentage scored by single player is 50%. 

#Q4:how often the host country was the winning country as well as determining the trend in consecutive winners.


57% of the winners are from Europe , and the rest (43%) is from South America. All the winners came from only 2 regions in the history of FIFA. It is obvious that the region is the strong factor to become a winner.

#Q5:To determine the range of penalty kicked, awarded and converted (scored) of the winners Vs non-winner

Looking at the scatter plots, the winning teams tend to have less number of penalty kicks received than non winning teams, but their conversion rate is higher than non winning teams.
To be exact, the winning team had 4 penalty kicks in total , 2 out of 4 , the conversion rate is 100% and 2 out of 4 , the conversion rate is 80% (missed only one penalty goal). If you miss more than 1 penalty kick, the chances of becoming a FIFA winner is gonna be slim.
